               <header>Creating Files</header>

               <p>
                  A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When
                  you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure on your local
                  computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking right before you
                  eventually upload them to a server. This guide discusses some issues you should be aware of so you can
                  set up a sensible file structure for your website.
               </p>

            <!-- FILE LOCATION -->
            <section class="main-section" id="File_Location">
               <header>File Location</header>

               <p>
                  When you are working on a website locally on your computer, you should keep all the related files in a
                  single folder that mirrors the published website's file structure on the server. This folder can live
                  anywhere you like, but you should put it somewhere where you can easily find it, maybe on your
                  Desktop, in your Home folder, or at the root of your hard drive.
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Choose a place to store your website projects. Inside your chosen place, create a new folder called
                     <code class="inline-code">web-projects</code> (or similar). This is where all your website projects
                     will live.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Inside this first folder, create another folder to store your first website in. Call it
                     <code class="inline-code">test-site</code> (or something more imaginative).
                  </li>

            <!-- NAMING YOUR FILES -->
            <section class="main-section" id="Naming_Your_Files">
               <header>Naming Your Files</header>

               <p>
                  It's important to note that when naming your folders and files, it's better to name them in lowercase
                  with no spaces. This is because:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     Many computers, particularly web servers, are case-sensitive. So for example, if you put an image
                     on your website at <code class="inline-code">test-site/MyImage.jpg</code> and then in a different
                     file you try to invoke the image as <code class="inline-code">test-site/myimage.jpg</code>, it may
                     not work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Browsers, web servers, and programming languages do not handle spaces consistently. For example, if
                     you use spaces in your filename, some systems may treat the filename as two filenames. Some servers
                     will replace the spaces in your filenames with "%20" (the character code for spaces in URLs),
                     resulting in all your links being broken. It's better to separate words with hyphens, rather than
                     underscores: <code class="inline-code">my-file.html</code> vs.
                     <code class="inline-code">my_file.html</code>.
                  </li>
               </ol>

               <p>
                  The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your file names. The Google search engine treats
                  a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way. For these reasons, it is best
                  to get into the habit of writing your folder and file names in lowercase with no spaces and with words
                  separated by hyphens, at least until you know what you're doing. That way you'll bump into fewer
                  problems down the road.

               <p>
                  The most common things you'll have on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders
                  to contain images, style files, and script files:
               </p>

               <ol class="list-sections">
                  <li class="section" id="index_html">
                     <strong><code class="inline-code">index.html</code>:</strong> This file will generally contain your
                     homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site.
                     This file should be saved in your <code class="inline-code">test-site</code> folder.
                  </li>
                  <li class="section" id="images_folder">
                     <strong><code class="inline-code">images</code> folder:</strong> This folder will contain all the
                     images that you use on your site. You'll store it in your
                     <code class="inline-code">test-site</code> folder.
                  </li>
                  <li class="section" id="styles_folder">
                     <strong><code class="inline-code">styles</code> folder:</strong> This folder will contain the CSS
                     code used to CSS style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). You'll store
                     this in your <code class="inline-code">test-site</code> folder as well. All your CSS files can be
                     created and saved as <code class="inline-code">fileName.css</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li class="section" id="scripts_folder">

                     when clicked). You'll store this in your <code class="inline-code">test-site</code> folder too. All
                     your Javascript files can be created and saved as <code class="inline-code">fileName.js</code>.

            <!-- FILE PATHS -->
            <section class="main-section" id="File_Paths">
               <header>File Paths</header>

               <p>
                  To make files talk to one another, you have to provide a file path between them — basically a route,
                  so one file knows where another one is. To demonstrate this, we'll show you a basic way that you can
                  reference an image that you saved in your <code class="inline-code">images</code> folder:
               </p>

               <div class="code-example">
                  <span class="alert hidden">Copied!</span>
                  <div class="code-copy-btn">
                     <i class="fa-regular fa-copy"></i>
                  </div>
                  <code>
                     <pre>

   <ct>body</ct>

</pre>
                  </code>
               </div>

               <p>
                  The image is inside the <code class="inline-code">images</code> directory (folder), which is in the
                  same directory as <code class="inline-code">index.html</code>. To walk down the file structure from
                  <code class="inline-code">index.html</code> to our image, the file path we'd need is
                  <code class="inline-code">images/your-image.png</code>. For example, if our image was called
                  <code class="inline-code">menu-icon.png</code>, so the file path in this case would
                  <code class="inline-code">images/firefox-icon.png</code>
               </p>

               <p>There are some general rules for file paths to note:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename,
                     e.g. <code class="inline-code">my-image.jpg</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a
                     forward slash, e.g. <code class="inline-code">subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots. So for
                     example, if <code class="inline-code">index.html</code> was inside a subfolder of test-site and
                     my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from
                     <code class="inline-code">index.html</code> using <code class="inline-code">../my-image.jpg</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     You can combine these as much as you like, for example
                     <code class="inline-code">../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>.
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <div class="note-card">
                  <p>
                     The Windows file system tends to use backslashes, not forward slashes, e.g.
                     <code class="inline-code">C:\Windows</code>. This doesn't matter in HTML — even if you are
                     developing your website on Windows, you should still use forward slashes in your code.
